This is a quick and dirty prototype.

It's about 60% complete all it needs is the save and loadsing characters,
printing character sheets (if we want to keep that feats), additional
text information for the user and a well designed charactersheet page 
(the last page of the program).

For the saving/loading you'll need to make a character object. The mainwindow.cpp
object I made is connected to every frame that would need a character object, 
I would suggect create a single character object in mainwindow's constructor 
and access it through the 1 mainwindow pointer I pass around.

Also You'll need to implement the rolling feature in the skills frame. I
have no idea how rolling works, so that one is on you guys.

I wrote this on a Mac, it's your responsibilty to make sure it runs on
windows, because that's how we have to demo it. My Mac cannot conenct to
any of the projectors, so we'll have to use someone's PC.

I think that's everything, if you want to improve the design go ahead,
if you find any bugs please fix them. Otherwise let me know if 
anything wasn't clear let me know.
